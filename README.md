# üç∑ Winzer

## Winzer connects wine enthusiasts with farmers through their events, promoting a social and human alternative to buying their wine third party. 

## Description

Create and costomize your profile to upload and/or participate in events. Use geo-location to find your position or search directly via leaflet-geo-search. If you like an event, you can join it and check out the party. If you decide to host, there are plenty of options to advertize your event. Chose a position on the map, title, description, a header image and a time frame. The events are also displayed on the profiles, so you know, if your favorite host has currently more events planned.
